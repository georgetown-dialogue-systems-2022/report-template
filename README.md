# Template for Dialogue Systems Final Project Report, Fall 2022

### Overview
For the final project submission, you will be expected to submit both a report and the code associated with your project. Below are details on getting setup for both.

#### Templates
*   **LaTeX template:** These files are provided to you in this repository. Based on the ACL 2023 template.
*   [Overleaf LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acl-2023-proceedings-template/qjdgcrdwcnwp) *Note:* You must remove `review` from the `acl2023` package argument.
*   **Word template**: This file is provided to you in this repository.

#### Software Requirements
For writing your report on your local machine, you must install a version of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) or [Microsoft Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word). Overleaf is cloud-based so a local installation of LaTeX is not necessary.

#### Local LaTeX Setup (not Overleaf)

*   [Possible Mac setup with Atom](http://economistry.com/2016/02/create-first-pdf-latex-atom-mac/)
*   [Possible Windows setup with Notepad++](https://nimal.info/blog/2010/latex-on-windows-with-miktex-and-notepad/)

#### Writing Advice
*   While the general organization of the final project report is up to you (as long as it follows the [Final Project Description](https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/159591/pages/final-project-description) by including an Introduction, Related Work, Approach, Evaluation, and Conclusions), one recommended format is from Svetlana Stoyanchev's class [here](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sstoyanchev/SDS2015/#project) (under `6. Final Report`).
*   For thinking about organization of demonstration papers (if you are considering submitting an eventual version of your work to a conference demonstration track), you can browse the SIGdial Demo Proceedings (e.g., [Abrams et al.](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-5948.pdf) or [Michael](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.sigdial-1.6.pdf) or [Papangelis et al.](https://www.sigdial.org/files/workshops/conference19/proceedings/pdf/SIGdial25.pdf)) or the [ACL Demo Proceedings](https://aclanthology.org/events/acl-2022/#2022-acl-demo) (e.g., [Lukin et al.](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-4016.pdf) or [Burstev et al.](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-4021.pdf)).

#### Software Repository Setup
*   Add or [transfer](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository) your repository to this organization.
*   [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) `report-template` for your own paper, or copy its contents into a folder like `report` in your repository.
*   Make a `README.md` for your project using [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

#### Git Large File System (LFS)
*   For large binary files (over 100MB), you may need to commit them with [Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage). There may be restrictions on file size that GitHub supports.
